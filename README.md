# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview:
In this module, I created an earthquake map with two different base-maps and an earthquake overlay.  For challenge, I was required to add earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates' location on earth and highlight all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on three separate base-maps.



## Results:
By the end of this challenge, I was able to:

- Retreive data from a GeoJSON file.
-  Make API requests to a server to host geographical maps.
- Populate geographical maps with GeoJSON data using JavaScript and the Data-Driven Documents (D3) library.
- Add multiple map layers to geographical maps using Leaflet control plugins to add user interface controls.
- Use JavaScript ES6 functions to add GeoJSON data, features, and interactivity to maps.
- Render maps on a local server.
